The provided code is a Python program designed to calculate and display the average grade, letter grade, and GPA based on the grades entered by the user for various subjects. 
Here's a detailed description of how the program works:
Defining the Main Function: The program defines a main function where the core logic resides.
Prompting for Number of Subjects: The user is asked to input the number of subjects they want to enter grades for. This input is converted to an integer.
Collecting Grades: A loop runs for the number of subjects specified by the user. In each iteration,
the user is prompted to enter a grade, which is converted to a floating-point number and added to a list called grades.
Calculating the Average Grade: The program calculates the average grade by summing all the grades in the list and dividing by the number of subjects.
Determining the Letter Grade and GPA: Based on the calculated average, the program assigns a corresponding letter grade and GPA using conditional statements:

An average of 90 or above results in an 'A' and a GPA of 4.0.
An average of 80 to 89 results in a 'B' and a GPA of 3.0.
An average of 70 to 79 results in a 'C' and a GPA of 2.0.
An average of 60 to 69 results in a 'D' and a GPA of 1.0.
An average below 60 results in an 'F' and a GPA of 0.0.
Displaying the Results: The program prints the average grade, the corresponding letter grade, and the GPA.

Running the Program: The final line checks if the script is being run directly (not imported as a module), and if so, it calls the main function to execute the program.
